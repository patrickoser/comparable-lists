Introdction: This is an app that will provide a simple and clean UI/UX for users to create lists and compare items on amazon.

A google extension that lets you add amazon products to a list that you can customize to help you compare different products side by side from amazon. You can create your profile and there will be a button on the side of the page that you can click to send that product to your comparison page and view all of the products you are interested in, side by side, and customize which details about the products that you want to see.

They will appear as cards on the screen. The app will pull in the pictures associated with the product, the title/name, the price and any relevant information in the product description. Allowing users to create there own custom lists that allows them to view these products side by side with a cleaner UI/UX experience.

Features: A login page.

A sign up page

A profile page displaying all of their lists.

The individual lists with the users products/information
There should be a widget that hovers on the side of each amazon product page that allows the user to click and send the product the current/active list or right click and add to a different list. 

An option to right click anywhere on the product page and add the product to a list should also be available.

When looking at the list section of amazon that displays products you searched for you should be able to right click on those and send them to lists without ever having to opne the full page.

Maybe add a little button to the picture or somewhere to the cards on amazon search page that resembles the widget you see on the full product page to make it even easier obvious how to add to the list.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available: 

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
